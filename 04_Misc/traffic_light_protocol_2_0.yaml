      TLP is a set of four labels used to indicate the sharing boundaries to be applied by the recipients.
      TLP provides a simple and intuitive schema for indicating with whom potentially sensitive information can be shared.

  terms:
    - community: >
        A group who share common goals, practices, and informal trust relationships.
        A community can be as broad as all cybersecurity practitioners in a country (or in a sector or region).
    - organization: >
        A group who share a common affiliation by formal membership and are bound by common policies set by the organization.
        An organization can be as broad as all members of an information sharing organization, but rarely broader.
    - clients: >
        Clients are those people or entities that receive cybersecurity services from an organization.
        Clients are by default included in TLP:AMBER so that the recipients may share information further downstream in order for clients to take action to protect themselves.
