    title: Hardware root of trust
    objective: >
      Ensure proper hardening process of workstations by creating a ‘root of trust’. Proper technology must be selected in order to fulfill this objective.
    risk_implication: >
      Improper hardening process may result in creating hardware vulnerabilities and attack vectors that can have severe implications that could lead to information theft, unauthorized access, and information disclosure.
    requirements:	
      - id: 2-1
        description: >
          PAWs must be built on trusted hardware provided by trusted and verified supplier/third party vendor. Hardware must be maintained by trusted supplier periodically.
