          users, generation date, expiration date, associated CA) for recovery 
          beyond the cryptoperiod of the keys.

        description: >
          The key archive must continue to provide the appropriate protections in 
          line with requirements included in the National Cryptographic Standards 
          document for each key and any other related information in the archive. 
          The archive must require a strong access-control mechanism to limit 
          access to only authorized organizations.

    title: Key Destruction
    objective: >
      Define requirements for the Key Destruction process to ensure proper key 
      destruction according to security rules.
    risk_implication: >
      If cryptographic keys are not destructed in line with the defined 
      requirements, this may result in e.g., the possibility to decrypt data by 
      compromised key and data leak which can have severe implications that could 
      lead to information theft, unauthorized access, and information disclosure.
    requirements:
      - id: 9-1
        description: >
          Keys must be removed when key lifetime expires and there is no need for 
          it to be archived or stored via a secure deletion process complied with 
          the National Security Standards document in order to minimize the risk 
          of a compromise. The key must be completely removed with all its 
          instances and make the recovery of that key impossible.
      - id: 9-2
        description: >
          All copies of secret (symmetric), public and private (asymmetric) keys 
          must be destroyed as soon as they are no longer required (e.g., for 
          archival or reconstruction activity) in order to minimize the risk of 
          a compromise.
      - id: 9-3
        description: >
          Secret (symmetric), public and private (asymmetric) keys must be 
          destroyed in a manner that removes all traces and records of the keys 
          so that they cannot be recovered by either physical or electronic means.
      - id: 9-4
        description: >
          A compromised key must be revoked as soon as possible.

          Public keys must be retained or destroyed depending on their future 
          needs associated with archiving, restoring or accountability.

        description: >
          Media storage systems storing keys must be sanitized before disposal 
          using a process compliant with NIST SP 800-88r1 or NSA/CSS Storage 
          Device Sanitization Manual.

    title: Key Accounting
    objective: >
      Define requirements for the Key Accounting process to ensure proper key 
      accounting according to security rules.
    risk_implication: >
      If cryptographic keys are not accounted in line with the defined 
      requirements, this may result in e.g. the impossibility of calling to 
      account the person responsible for key misuse or key compromise which can 
      have severe implications that could lead to information theft, unauthorized 
      access, and information disclosure.
    requirements:
      - id: 10-1
        description: >
          Use of asymmetric keys must be monitored by <organization name>'s 
          <cybersecurity function> or nominated by <cybersecurity function> key 
          owners/administrator through dedicated tools.
      - id: 10-2
        description: >
          Key usage must be accounted for. Accountability process must involve 
          the identification of those that have access to, or control of, 
          cryptographic keys throughout their lifecycles.

    objective: >
      The key management process must be securely configured and performed and 
      meet other associated standards.

      If <organization name> is not compliant with all applicable and mandatory 
      standards and requirements, it could be exposed to severe threat rise
