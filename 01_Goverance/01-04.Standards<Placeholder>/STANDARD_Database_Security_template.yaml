purpose: >
  This standard aims to define the detailed cybersecurity requirements related to <organization's name>’s Database Management System (DBMS) هي in order to minimize cybersecurity risks resulting from internal and external threats at <organization's name>.
  The requirements in this standard are aligned with the Database Security Policy and the cybersecurity requirements issued by the <Governing Body> in addition to other related cybersecurity legal and regulatory requirements.

scope:
  description: >
    This standard covers all <organization name>’s information technology assets (including DBMS) and applies to all personnel (employees and contractors) in <organization name>.

standards:
  secure_hardening_configuration:
    objective: "To define basic DBMS security requirements to ensure that the DBMS is securely designed, configured, and operated."
    risk_implication: >
      Faults in DBMS configuration and weak designs are among the top reasons leading to security vulnerabilities that can be exploited to jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of <organization name>’s data.
    requirements:
      - "1-1 Naming conventions must be different to distinguish between production and non-production servers."
      - "1-2 DBMS servers must be dedicated and must not host any other functionality such as 'Web or Application Tier' or 'Domain Services.'"
      - "1-3 Default database table names must be changed; must not be limited to the tables only & address all default configurations."
      - "1-4 Only stored and available procedures for the application must be used to make transactions or queries from the database."
      - "1-5 DBMS servers links (such as creating connections or interfaces) must be isolated between production and non-production DBMS(s)."
      - "1-6 Data validation must be used to ensure the integrity of stored data."
      - "1-7 Database fields must be limited to specific ranges of input and queries. In addition, dual input, or other input checks (such as Boundary Checking and Content Inspection/URL Filtering) must be used to limit transactions such as:
        - Missing and/or incomplete data
        - Out of range values
        - Unauthorized or inconsistent data
        - Invalid characters in data fields
        - Exceeding upper or lower date volume limits"
      - "1-8 Access to all DBMS configuration files, as well as to the source code of applications/scripts stored in the database, must be controlled, and monitored."
      - "1-9 An accurate inventory of all databases and their contents must be maintained and regularly updated & reviewed."
      - "1-10 Data stored in databases must be labeled using predefined types of security labels as per <organization name>’s relevant policies and procedures; and related controls must be applied."

  audit_logs:
    objective: "To generate DBMS logs for critical security events, and record and secure them on the DBMS to help with future investigations, tracking, and verifications."
    risk_implication: >
      Insufficient audit logs limit <organization name>’s ability to detect security compromises, incidents, and issues and track them on the DBMS, and undermine its ability to determine the causes of such security compromises. Failing to properly secure audit logs on the DBMS can lead to tampering with logs, thereby impacting their integrity.
    requirements:
      - "2-1 All DBMS clocks must be synchronized with centrally trusted Network Time Protocol (NTP) source."
      - "2-2 Logs must be appended to the operating system logs or be self-contained within the DBMS."
      - "2-3 Audit records containing detailed information must be generated to establish the identity of any user/subject or process associated with the event."
      - "2-4 The following DBMS activities must be recorded and logged at minimum mention changes on DB record level and the timestamp of the event:
        - All raised system alarms or errors
        - Start up
        - Shutdown
        - The creation, alteration, or deletion (drop) of databases, and any database storage structures, tables, indexes, accounts and objects
        - Enabling and disabling of audit functionality
        - Granting and revoking of DBMS system level privileges
        - Any action that returns an error message because the object referenced does not exist
        - Any action that renames a DBMS object
        - Any action that grants or revokes object privileges from a DBMS role or account
        - All modifications to the data dictionary or DBMS system configuration
        - Audits of all DBMS connection failures where possible. DBA must ensure that both successful and unsuccessful connection attempts are audited
        - Stating a threshold and triggering alert of failed logon attempts, and password locks
        - Attempts to add, modify or delete privileges/permissions
        - Deletion of categories of information (such as classification levels/security levels)
        - Abnormal command (command calling another command, etc.)
        - Disabling or modifying DBMS's logs"
      - "2-5 An immediate real-time alert must be raised to appropriately support individuals with all audit failure events requiring real-time action(s)."
      - "2-6 Audit features in the DBMS must be protected against unauthorized removal."
      - "2-7 DBMS must be configured to send the event logs to SIEM in accordance with the <organization name>’s approved cybersecurity event and logging standard."

  other_standards:
    objective: "To implement all database security standards and requirements to ensure the highest protection levels."
    risk_implication: >
      Failure to implement all security standards and requirements exposes <organization name> to increasing database security risks.
    requirements:
      - "3-1 The following standards must be implemented:
        - Identity and access management standard
        - Disaster recovery and backup standard
        - Cryptography standard
        - Server security standard
        - Physical security standard"
