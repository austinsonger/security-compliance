Purpose:
  - >
    This standard aims to define the detailed cybersecurity requirements related to data protection for <organization name>. This standard is intended to define a set of cybersecurity controls to ensure the data protection of <organization name> information assets.
Scope:
  - >
    This standard covers all <organization name>’s information technology assets and applies to all personnel (employees and contractors) in <organization name>.
Standards:
  1:
    title: Identity and Access Management
    Objective: >
      The objective of this section is to ensure secure logical access to data assets in order to prevent unauthorized access and allow only authorized access.
    Risk Implication: >
      Improper management of data access may cause unauthorized access to critical data, which can lead to data damage, data loss, or data theft.
    Requirements:
      1-1: >
        User authorization must be based on identity and access control principles, which are:
        - Need-to-Know,
        - Need-to-Use,
        - Least Privilege,
        - Segregation of Duties.
      1-2: >
        All access to data must be controlled using identification and authentication mechanisms. This access control must:
        a) Assign privileges to individuals based on the individual’s job classification and function.
        b) Restrict privileges to the minimum needed for the individual or service to perform their duties.
        c) Deny all access that is not explicitly granted.
        d) Remove all system access not explicitly required.
        e) Review user's identities and access rights periodically.
      1-3: >
        Device, service, and application accounts must be assigned to an account owner and must not be used by individuals to access the related device, service, or application. These accounts and their associated passwords must be managed by the enterprise privileged account management tool.
      1-4: >
        All accounts must be reviewed upon changes in user role and at least annually for user accounts or user groups which handle public and confidential data. Privileged accounts and service accounts, or accounts which handle secret and top-secret levels of data must be reviewed every 6 months.
  2:
    title: Data and Information Privacy
    Objective: >
      The objective of this section is to ensure that privacy requirements of data and information are implemented.
    Risk Implication: >
      Insufficient or lack of data privacy practices may lead to unauthorized access to confidential data, which may result in data leak or data loss.
    Requirements:
      2-1: >
        <Organization name> must consider privacy at the initial design stages and throughout the complete development process of new systems, applications, databases, products, processes, or services that involve processing personally identifying information (PII).
      2-2: >
        Privacy by Design must be embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems processing personally identifying information (PII) to ensure that current, new or changes to the systems that collect, or process personally identifying information (PII) satisfy requirements.
      2-3: >
        When applicable, <Organization name> must apply suitable data pseudonymization / anonymization techniques to meet the requirements of Privacy by Design principle.
      2-4: >
        The default system settings must be the most privacy friendly (data minimization principle), if a system or service includes choices for data subjects on how much personally identifying information (PII) is shared.
      2-5: >
        <Organization name> must put appropriate technical and organizational measures in place to ensure that only necessary personally identifying information (PII) are processed by default.
      2-6: >
        Security controls outlined in this document must be aligned with the privacy requirements. <Organization name> should have a separate policy/standard/requirement for data privacy.
  3:
    title: Data in Transit Encryption
    Objective: >
      The objective of this section is to define the encryption requirements of specific data, based on its classification, risk assessment results, and use case.
    Risk Implication: >
      Improper or lack of encryption of data in transit may lead to sending confidential data - Intentionally or unintentionally - to someone who has no legitimate access to it or sharing it publicly.
    Requirements:
      3-1: >
        <organization name> must use encryption on all critical systems data during transfer (Data-In-Transit), using updated and secure encryption methods, algorithms, and keys in accordance with relevant National Cryptographic Standards.
      3-2: >
        Encryption must be used if electronic personally identifiable information (PII) is transmitted (through, but not limited to, e-mail, (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), instant messaging, e-fax, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP).
      3-3: >
        Encryption (with the use of WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) or higher level cryptographic protocol) must be used if connecting to the internal network(s) over a wireless network.
      3-4: >
        Encryption must be used if remotely accessing an <organization name>’s internal network(s) or devices over a shared (e.g., Internet) or personal (e.g., Bluetooth, NFC) network. This does not apply to remote access over an <organization name>’s managed point to point dedicated connection.
      3-5: >
        Encryption must be used if data is being transmitted with an <organization name> public facing website and/or web services, they are required to utilize Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) in lieu of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) where technically feasible. Public facing websites must utilize (HTTP) Strict Transport Security (HSTS), automatically redirecting (HTTP) requests to (HTTPS) websites where technically feasible.
      3-6: >
        <organization name> must use appropriate encryption methods for data in transit including, but are not limited to, Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or later, Secure Shell (SSH) 2.0 or later, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) version 2 or later (with Wi-Fi Protected Setup disabled) and encrypted Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) as prescribed by NCA in (NCS-1:2020).

    title: Media Disposal
    Objective: >
      Information systems which capture, process, and store information using a wide variety of media, including paper may require special disposal, in order to mitigate unauthorized access to data and to ensure its confidentiality.
    Risk Implication: >

    Requirements:
      5-1: >
        <organization name> must perform the clearing of data with overwriting data as a sanitization method, in case the media will be reused and will not be leaving the <organization name>‘s control in order to prevent information to be retrieved by data, disk or file recovery utilities.
      5-2: >
        <organization name> must use purging data as sanitization method if the media will be reused and will be leaving the <organization name>‘s control, in order to protect confidentiality of information against an attack through either degaussing or secure erase.
      5-3: >
        <organization name> must physically destroy data as a sanitization method, if the media will not be reused at all, in order to completely destroy the media.
      5-4: >
