    title: Plan risk response
    objective: >
      The objective of this section is to ensure that the organization is managing the patching in accordance with the assessment of the incoming cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities.
    risk_implication: >
      Without patching being done in consequence of the <organization name>’s overall risk and vulnerability management processes (e.g., only being done as an operational duty), the chance of letting potential vulnerabilities untreated is higher.
