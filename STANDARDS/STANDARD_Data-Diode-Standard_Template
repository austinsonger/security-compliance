        Physical access to the data diode must be restricted to authorized system administrators only and protected by physical security perimeters.
    title: 3. Configuration Management
    Objective: >
      Define requirements for the data diode configuration management process to ensure proper and secure process flow according to defined security rules.
    Risk Implication: >
      If data diode basic configurations are not defined and the configuration management process is not performed in line with security standards, this can have severe implications that could breach the process and operating continuity and cause financial losses.
    Requirements:
      3-1: >
        Baseline security configurations for data diodes including connectivity, operational, and communications aspects of systems must be developed, documented and formally reviewed.
      3-2: >
        The management/diagnostic interface must provide a possibility to log events and forward them to other security systems or log servers.
      3-3: >
        The data diode must provide backup and restore functions to allow administrators to export and import data diode settings.
      3-4: >
        The data diode must collect and forward logs of any events that may be defined in the scope of audit inspection.
      3-5: >
        The data diode solution must be configured to send only specific logs to the central log system using e.g. SYSLOG protocol and CEF, LEEF or RFC 5425 specified log formats.
    title: 4. Physical and Environmental Protection
    Objective: >
      Define requirements for the data diode physical and environmental protection to ensure proper and secure process flow according to defined security rules.
    Risk Implication: >
      Lack of data diodes physical and environmental protection can have severe implications that could breach the environment and process which can have an impact into operating continuity and cause safety incidents or financial losses.
    Requirements:
      4-1: >

      4-3: >
        The data diode hardware components must ensure high availability (e.g. redundant power).
    title: 5. System and Communication Protection
    Objective: >
      Define requirements for the data diode system and communication protection to ensure proper and secure process flow according to defined security rules.
    Risk Implication: >
