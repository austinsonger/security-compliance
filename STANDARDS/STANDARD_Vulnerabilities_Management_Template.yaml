          Vulnerability assessment exercise must be conducted as per the relevant legislative and regulatory requirements, and it must take into account the following guidelines:
          - The exercise must meet specific vulnerability assessment requirements which are mentioned in the procedures.
          - The exercise must define the systems/applications targeted for assessment, as well as any targeted system/application specific requirements.
          - The assessment must include network-related vulnerabilities, service-based vulnerabilities, and banner grabbing.
          - Vulnerability assessment must be performed using approved methods and mechanisms.
          - Vulnerability assessment tools must be hardened to resist unauthorized use or modification, and the tool’s configuration settings must not be altered. If a tool configuration change is required, <organization name> must be notified and approve of the change.
          - Vulnerability assessment reports must be classified as "Secret" at least, protected by a password, and shared only with related entities.
          - Risk rating must be determined to prioritize findings as per the cybersecurity risk management methodology.
