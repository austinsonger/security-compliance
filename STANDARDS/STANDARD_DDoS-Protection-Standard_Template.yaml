Table A – DDoS protection solution deployment methodologies:
  Methodology:
    DDoS Protection as a Service:
      Description: >
        Application of service providers’ solutions. DDoS Protection as a Service is usually implemented by redirecting network traffic to an external scrubbing center.
    On-premise (hardware):
      Description: >
        Deployment of the solution on the <organization name>’s network, which is performed by installing the hardware in its network.
    Hybrid:
      Description: >
        This methodology combines deployment as a service with on-premise to mitigate volumetric attacks as close to the source of the attack as possible, and mitigate application DDoS attacks on the perimeter of <organization name>’s network using the resource of Cloud/ISP scrubbing center if the DDoS attack exceeds the capability of the on-prem hardware.

  - Standard Owner: <head of the cybersecurity function>
  - Standard Review and Update: <cybersecurity function>
  - Standard Implementation and Execution: <information technology function> and <cybersecurity function>
  - Standard Compliance Measurement: <cybersecurity function>
Update and Review:
