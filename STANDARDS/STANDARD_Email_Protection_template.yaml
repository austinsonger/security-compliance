standards:
  content_filtering_and_analysis:
    objective: >
      To ensure the protection of email addresses from spam email messages, phishing email messages, malicious Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and any other type of harmful content.
    risk_implication: >
      Users may be deceived by email messages that contain malicious and suspicious content, and <organization name> may be exposed to cyberattacks if email messages are not checked and verified.
    requirements:
      - "1-1 All <organization name>’s inbound and outbound email messages must be scanned for malicious and suspicious content."
      - "1-2 All <organization name>’s inbound and outbound email messages must be labeled with appropriate protective labeling reflecting the sensitivity and confidentiality levels based on the data classification level and as per <organization name>’s Data Classification Policy and the results of content analysis.
