Purpose: >
  This standard aims to define the detailed cybersecurity requirements related to the backup and recovery of all of <organization name>'s information technology assets to minimize cybersecurity risks resulting from internal and external threats at <organization name> in order to preserve confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Scope: >
  This standard covers all information technology assets (e.g., systems, data, and information) in <organization name> and applies to all <organization name> personnel (employees and contractors).
Standards:
  Data Backup and Recovery Processes:
    Objective: >
      To define a backup process for each IT system used by <organization name>.
    Risk Implication: >
      Lack of a backup process may result in the loss of data and information in the event of a system error, unplanned shutdown or compromise. Lack of a backup process may mean that an IT system cannot be restored to a known time point and known condition, adversely affecting business operations and placing <organization name> in breach of legal or regulatory obligations.
    Requirements:
      1-1: >
        Data backup processes and procedures must be defined for all IT systems, including cloud, remote access, telework, and critical systems, used by <organization name> including third-party hosted systems in alignment with <organization name>’s Data Classification Standard.
      1-2: >
        A Business Impact Assessment (BIA) must be carried out by the system owner and business users of the system to determine the frequency and type of backup required.
      1-3: >
        Recovery Time and Recovery Point Objectives (RTO and RPO) must be determined by the system owner and business users of the system using the results of the Business Impact Assessment (BIA).
      1-4: >
        System owners must be responsible for defining the data backup processes and procedures for the systems for which they have responsibility. At a minimum, data backup processes and procedures must include the following requirements:
        a) authorized personnel with access to backups and backup media
        b) operational procedures
        c) backup logging procedure
        d) frequency (e.g. daily, weekly or monthly) to meet business impact analysis Recovery Time and Recovery Point Objectives
        e) a record of system and application files to be backed up (e.g. operating system, or application executables)
        f) a record of data and information to be backed up (e.g. static data, customer files or transaction records)
        g) backup type (e.g. incremental or full)
        h) medium (e.g. tape, disk, cloud)
        i) storage (e.g. onsite, offsite, rotation)
        j) records of backup (e.g. date, media and storage location)
        k) retention periods
        l) log monitoring and error resolution procedures (e.g. rerunning a failed backup within a set timeframe)
        m) testing procedures (e.g. backup verification)
        n) data restoration procedures and timescales
        o) data encryption requirements
      1-5: >
        The use of personal removable media of any kind (e.g., external USB drives) as a backup medium must be prohibited.
  Protection of Backup Media:
    Objective: >
      To protect backup media.
    Risk Implication: >
      Unprotected or improperly stored and handled backup media can be damaged, lost, stolen or compromised. Damage to backup media may adversely impact the restore of an IT system or associated data and information; loss or theft may mean that a restore cannot be carried out and, depending on the data and information stored on the backup media, may expose <organization name> to legal or regulatory investigations and penalties.
    Requirements:
      2-1: >
        Backup media must be stored in a secure and fireproof location when not in use and protected from environmental risks (e.g., flooding).
      2-2: >
        Backup media must be stored separately from live media (i.e., streaming media) using online storage (such as implementing a dedicated backup network or implementing network physical and/or logical segmentation).
      2-3: >
        Access to backup media must be restricted and limited to authorized personnel with appropriate business need.
      2-4: >
        Authorized personnel who can access backup media and the justification of access must be identified and documented.
      2-5: >
        Physical backup media (e.g. disks, tapes, etc.) must be moved to a <organization name>’s approved secure offsite location immediately after creation or use.
      2-6: >
        Physical backup media must be transported to and from offsite locations using a secure method of transportation (such as a dedicated courier and security box).
      2-7: >
        The ability to recall offsite backup media must be restricted to authorized personnel.
      2-8: >
        All requests for the recovery of backup data must be logged in a centralized location (i.e., a backup request log). The backup request log must record, at a minimum:
        a) the time of the request
        b) the identity of the individual making the request
        c) the business reason for the request
        d) the system backup required
        e) identity of individual approving or denying the request (denials must be accompanied with a reason why the request was denied).
      2-9: >
        The backup request log must be stored in a secure manner, with access limited to authorized personnel, using physical and logical access controls.
      2-10: >
        Review and inventory at least annually all physical backup media.
      2-11: >
        Physical backup media must be replaced before they reach manufacturer’s stated end of life.
  Backup Test and Restore:
    Objective: >
      To test data backup data for completeness and restoration.
    Risk Implication: >
      Damage to or corruption of backup media and corruption of data and information stored on the backup media will not be identified. This may adversely impact the restore of an IT system or of the associated data and information.
    Requirements:
      3-1: >
        All backups must be tested and verified after they have been run to ensure the backup taken has been done successfully. For example, checking file size, using hash totaling or deploying other methods of verification.
      3-2: >
        A backup restoration test must be conducted periodically as the per the following:
        a) once a year for all backups.
        b) once every three months for critical systems’ backups.
        c) once every six months for remote work systems’ backups.
      3-3: >
        The restoration test must be reviewed to check if the restoration occurred within or met defined timescales.
  Protection of Online Backups:
    Objective: >
      To protect online backups.
    Risk Implication: >
      Improper, or no, protection of online backups may result in unauthorized access, modification or deletion of backup data and information. This may adversely impact the restore of an IT system or associated data and information.

  Backup and Data Retention Requirements:
    Objective: >
      To retain and manage data and backups according to legislation, regulation, and policy.
    Risk Implication: >
      Retaining data and information for incorrect periods of time may lead to breaches of legislation, regulation, and policy.
    Requirements:
      5-1: >

        f) how long a request to delete data/backup will take
        g) what mechanism will be used to prove deletion has occurred and is permanent
        h) how encryption keys (if used) will be destroyed
        i) how the request and deletion is recorded in a secure manner.
      5-5: >
        All requests for the deletion of backup data must be logged in a centralized location (the backup deletion log). The backup deletion log must record, at a minimum:
