            Any user, system or workstation that was used in, or was part of, the penetration testing exercise must be controlled and monitored to ensure that they are used only for the purpose of the testing exercise.
        - 1-8: >
            Any user, system or workstation that was used in, or was part of, the penetration testing exercise must be removed or restored to normal behavior and access after the testing exercise.
        - 1-9: >
            A report must be developed for each failed or incomplete penetration testing exercise. The report must highlight the challenges faced by the test team to understand and resolve them, and redo the exercise.
  - penetration_testing_mechanism:
      objective: >
        To define penetration testing mechanism, tools and technology to be followed by internal and external penetration testing team prior to initiating the penetration testing process.
      risk_implication: >
        Improper penetration testing can lead to new vulnerabilities, unauthorized access or continuation of unknown vulnerabilities in the environment, which can lead to inconclusive results. In addition, it could lead to exfiltration or exposure of data that may cause damage systems, services and technology components.
      requirements:
