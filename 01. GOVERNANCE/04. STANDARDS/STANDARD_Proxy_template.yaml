      - id: 2-7
        description: >
          Proxy server must provide the ability to translate protocols from one side of the conversation to the other. For example, if a client is only capable of IPv4, the proxy can be used to proxy a conversation to an IPv6 web server, enabling access even without IPv6 support on the client side. Likewise, an IPv6-only client or environment can access an IPv4 web server through a web proxy.

    title: Logging and Monitoring
    objective: >
      All sensitive events related to proxy security must be monitored and stored for the proactive detection of cybersecurity attacks.
    risk_implication: >

    Proxy deployment methodologies
  methodologies:
    - name: Inline
      description: >
        Inline deployment is commonly used in small organizations due to the ease of deployment and the absolute security level it provides. With an inline deployment, the web gateway is placed directly in the path of all network traffic going to and from the Internet. If you choose an inline deployment, make sure your web gateway is capable of bypassing network traffic that you don’t want processed by the web gateway. In many instances, you can choose to either “proxy” (re-route) or “bypass” a specific protocol. If you “proxy” the protocol, it means the web gateway will terminate the traffic from the client to the server locally and re-establish a new connection acting as the client to the server to get the requested information.
    - name: Explicit
      description: >
        Explicit deployment is commonly used when a web gateway is deployed in a larger network, and the design of the network requires there to be no single point of failure. Explicit deployment allows the web gateway to be located on the network in any location that is accessible by all users and the device itself has access to the Internet. Explicit deployment uses an explicit definition in a web browser. To facilitate this kind of deployment an administrator can distribute PAC or WPAD files for the explicit proxy setup in end-user browsers.
    - name: Transparent
      description: >
        Transparent deployment allows a web gateway to be deployed in any network location that has connectivity, similarly to explicit mode deployment, reducing the need for a configuration change to the network to implement. In addition, there is no administrative overhead to configure end-user systems, since the routing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic is typically done by the router or other network device. Transparent deployment is often used when an organization is too large for an inline deployment and does not want the added work and overhead needed for an explicit deployment. Most transparent deployments rely on web Caching Communications Protocol (WCCP), a protocol supported by many network devices. Alternatively, transparent deployment can be achieved using Policy Based Routing (PBR) or usage of application delivery controllers.
    - name: Span
      description: >
        SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer) port deployment is sometimes called TCP Reset deployment, as it relies on TCP resets to implement the policy of the web gateway. A web gateway is deployed by attaching it to a SPAN port on a switch. Unlike the other three deployment methods, which process the web traffic and implement policies based on the network response to the web gateway issues, a web gateway deployed on a SPAN port implements policies by issuing a TCP reset to the client system to prevent completing a download of offending content.
    - name: Reverse
      description: >
        A reverse proxy is commonly deployed as a server that sits in front of one or more web servers, intercepting requests from clients. This is different from a forward proxy, where the proxy sits in front of the clients. Reverse proxy forwards client (e.g., web browser) requests to web servers. Reverse proxies are typically implemented to help increase security, performance, and reliability (e.g., to avoid state or institutional browsing restrictions, to block access to certain content or to protect identity online).
