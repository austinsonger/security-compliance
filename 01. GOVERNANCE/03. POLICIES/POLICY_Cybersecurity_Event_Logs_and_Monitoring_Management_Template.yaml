      - 1-1-3: >
          System from which the event was performed (e.g. mail server).
      - 1-1-4: >
          Date and Time of Event.
      - 1-1-5: >

          Monitor all cybersecurity events 24/7/365 by specialized teams.
      - 1-7: >
          Monitor social media accounts and login attempts to ensure the operation of systems 24/7/365, and collect relevant logs.
      - 1-8: >
          The systems to be monitored must activate event logs when one of the following events at least occurs:
      - 1-8-1: >
          Cybersecurity events on all technical components of the systems to be monitored, including OT, databases, storage, applications, and networks.
      - 1-8-2: >
          Cybersecurity events of industrial network and associated communications.
