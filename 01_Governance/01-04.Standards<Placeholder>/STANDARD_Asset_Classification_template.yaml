Purpose:
  Description: >
    This standard aims to define the detailed cybersecurity requirements related to the asset classification of <organization name>'s systems, data and information to minimize cybersecurity risks resulting from internal and external threats at <organization's name> in order to preserve confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
Scope:
  Description: >
    This standard covers all assets (e.g., physical, data, business application, software and technology assets) in the <organization name> and applies to all personnel (employees and contractors) in the <organization name>.
Standards:
  1. Asset classification:
    Objective: To classify all assets owned and managed by the <organization name>.
    Risk Implication: >
      The lack of development and implementation of asset classification in <organization name>, will fail to protect assets by using improper protective measures, controls or handling critical assets incorrectly which may lead to exposure or breach.
    Requirements:
      1-1: All assets owned and managed by <organization name> must be classified.
      1-2: >
        Physical assets (e.g., network connection devices, IDS/IPS, storage assets and critical systems’ peripherals) must be classified by reference to the highest classification of the information input, processed, stored or transmitted on the physical asset.
      1-3: >
        Business application and software assets must be classified by reference to the highest classification of the information input, processed, stored, transmitted or deleted by users of the application or software.
      1-4: >
        Third party and suppliers must be classified by reference to the highest classification of the information input, processed, stored, transmitted or deleted by the third party or supplier.
      1-5: >
        Any asset (information, physical, business application, software and third party and supplier) that inputs, processes, stores, transmits or deletes personal and/or sensitive information must be classified as “Critical”, “High”, “Moderate”, “Low” in addition to any other classification required.
  2. Physical asset labelling:
    Objective: To label all physical assets owned by the organization.
    Risk Implication: >
      Unlabeled assets can be difficult to track, monitor or return to <organization name>. An unlabeled asset may not be included in an asset register, which can lead to the asset not being updated or maintained in the appropriate manner. Unlabeled physical assets may be handled incorrectly, which may result in damage, theft or loss.
    Requirements:
      2-1: All physical assets owned by the organization must have a tamper-proof label attached.
      2-2: >
        The tamper proof label must show the unique identifier assigned to the asset in the asset register as a number, bar code or QR code.
      2-3: The tamper proof label must contain a contact number.
      2-4: >
        The tamper proof label must not contain <organization name>, <organization name> logo or other identifying marks or texts.
  3. Physical asset handling:
    Objective: To protect assets by handling them in a secure manner.
    Risk Implication: >
      Improper or careless handling of physical assets can lead to damage, loss or theft of the asset and any information stored or accessible on the device. Depending on the asset and information, <organization name> may be exposed to legal or regulatory investigations and penalties.
    Requirements:
      3-1: >
        Physical assets (excluding assets recognized as mobile devices) must not be removed from their designated location.
      3-2: >
        Approval must be obtained from the asset owner if a physical asset is to be removed from its designated location.
      3-3: >
        Storage media, such as hard disk drives, that has been used to store classified information classified as “Top Secret”, “Secret”, “Confidential” must be securely erased using a published erasure method such that data cannot be retrieved (e.g., NIST SP800-88 Rev.1).
      3-4: >
        Storage, such as hard disk drives, that has been used to store classified information classified as classified information classified as “Top Secret”, “Secret”, “Confidential” must be physically destroyed (e.g. by shredding to Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) 66399 standard as O-5 and H-5 or incineration).
  4. Mobile device physical asset handling:
    Objective: To protect mobile devices by handling them in a secure manner.
    Risk Implication: >
      Improper or careless handling of mobile assets can lead to damage, loss or theft of the asset and any information stored or accessible on the device. Depending on the asset and information, <organization name> may be exposed to legal or regulatory investigations and penalties.
    Requirements:
      4-1: >
        Users of mobile devices (such as laptops, mobile phones and portable storage devices) that may input, process, store, transmit or delete classified data must be trained at least once a year in the secure handling of the devices and data. The users must acknowledge they have received and completed the training.
      4-2: Mobile devices must be returned to a central location for disposal.
      4-3: >
        Storage, such as hard disk drives, in mobile devices that have been used to store classified information classified as “Top Secret”, “Secret”, “Confidential” must be securely erased using a published erasure method such that data cannot be retrieved following decommissioning (e.g. NIST SP800-88 Rev.1).
      4-4: >
        Storage, such as hard disk drives, in mobile devices that have been used to store classified information classified as “Top Secret”, “Secret”, “Confidential” must be physically destroyed following decommissioning (e.g., by shredding to DIN 66399 standard O-5 and H-5 or incineration).
      4-5: >
        Portable storage devices that have been used to store classified information must be physically destroyed following decommissioning (e.g., by shredding to DIN 66399 standard O-5 and H-5 or incineration).
  5. Information asset labelling:
    Objective: To label information assets with their classification.
    Risk Implication: >
      Unlabeled information assets will not be handled correctly, raising the likelihood of exposure or breach.
    Requirements:
      5-1: >
        Classified information assets in digital format (files, databases or emails) must be labelled electronically (e.g. by using headers and footers in documents, file naming conventions, or digital signatures).

  6. Information asset handling:
    Objective: To handle information assets in a secure manner.
    Risk Implication: >
