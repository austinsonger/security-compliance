Purpose:
  - >
    This standard aims to define the detailed cybersecurity requirements related to the data loss prevention of <organization name>'s data to minimize cybersecurity risks resulting from internal and external threats at <organization's name> in order to preserve confidentiality, integrity and availability.
Scope:
  - >
    This standard covers all <organization name>’s enterprise data and applies to all <organization name> personnel (employees and contractors).
Standards:
    title: 1. Data and information type and vector definition
    Objective: >
      To define the types of data and information to be monitored and the vectors by which such data and information can leak from the organization
    Risk implication: >
      A poor, or no definition, of the types of data and information and vectors to be monitored may mean that data loss approaches are not designed and implemented correctly, allowing data and information to leave <organization name>.
    Requirements:
      1-1: >
        The types of data and information to be monitored must be defined by asset owners and the <head of cybersecurity function>, with input from other stakeholders, at <organization name>.
      1-2: >
        The type of data and information to be monitored must include:
        a) all data and information that must be monitored due to legal and regulatory obligations applicable to <organization name>.
        b) all data and information classified as “Restricted” or above (see Data Classification Policy).
        c) all data and information that are considered as personal.
        d) all data and information that must be monitored to meet operational and commercial obligations with third parties and suppliers.
      1-3: >
        A Data Loss Prevention (DLP) register of the types of data and information to be monitored must be identified, documented, and approved.
      1-4: >
        The legal, regulatory, operational and commercial obligations placed on <organization name> must be reviewed at least once a year.
      1-5: >
        Where required, the DLP register of data and information to be monitored must be updated to reflect changes identified in the review.
      1-6: >
        The vectors by which data and information can exit/transfer from <organization name> must be investigated. The investigation must prioritize the data and information listed in the DLP register.
      1-7: >
        A list of the vectors such as network (email clients, file transfer protocol (FTP) clients and similar), systems (data recorders, printers, removable storage and similar) and applications by which data and information contained in the DLP register can exit/transfer from <organization name> must be created and maintained.
      1-8: >
        The list of vectors must be reviewed at least once a year.
      1-9: >
        Where required, the list of vectors must be updated to reflect changes identified in the review.
    title: 2. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tool
    Objective: >
      To deploy a DLP tool to monitor and control the movement of data and information listed in the DLP register
    Risk implication: >
      Not automating the monitoring of data and information will result in <organization name> having to use manual processes (or no process at all) to find and stop data and information leakage, reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of data leak prevention approaches
    Requirements:
      2-1: >
        The DLP tool must be managed centrally.
      2-2: >
        Access to the DLP tool must be restricted and limited to authorized employees, using physical and logical access controls in accordance with <organization name> approved Physical Security Policy and Identity and Access Management Policy.
      2-3: >
        An owner for the DLP tool must be appointed in accordance with relevant policies approved by <organization name>.
    title: 3. DLP tool configuration
    Objective: >
      To configure a DLP tool to monitor and control the movement of data and information listed in the DLP register
    Risk implication: >
      Incorrect configuration of the DLP tool may result in data and information being leaked outside <organization name>
    Requirements:
      3-1: >
        The DLP tool must be configured to identify all data and information listed in the DLP register, where technically feasible.
      3-2: >
        DLP tool must be configured to monitor and control the movement of data listed in the DLP register using technical DLP policies, defining a set of DLP tool rules, including:
        a) what data can and cannot be sent, posted, uploaded, moved or copied and pasted.
        b) where data can be transmitted.
        c) how data can be shared.
      3-3: >
        The DLP tool must be configured to scan known vectors of data loss.
      3-4: >
        The DLP tool must be configured to use one or more of the following detection techniques:
        a) content matching
        b) indexing or fingerprinting
        c) optional character recognition
        d) other detection techniques as provided by the tool
      3-5: >
        The DLP tool must be configured to enforce the DLP tool rules by one or more of the following mechanisms:
        a) blocking the transmission of data and information listed in the DLP register
        b) quarantining messages before transmission
        c) blocking copy and paste to external storage devices
        d) logging all violations
      3-6: >
