    title: General Requirements
    objective: >
      The NDR solution must be securely designed and appropriately used when required.
    risk_implication: >
      Misconfiguration of the NDR solution may reduce the success of threat 
      identification and result in information theft, unauthorized access, and 
      information disclosure.

        description: >
          NDR must combine data science, machine learning and behavioral analysis 
          with well-curated threat intelligence in order to identify in real time 
          or near real time the intent of network traffic and reveal malicious 
          behaviors, independent of applications and even when traffic is encrypted 
          and provide assistance with manual incident and threat hunting response 
          through automation.
      - id: 1-2

      - id: 1-9
        description: >
          Each management communication channel must be using a dedicated management 
          network or the management network communications which is authenticated 
          and encrypted using validated cryptographic modules that are in line with 
          the National Cryptography Standard’s Key Lifecycle Management requirements.
      - id: 1-10
        description: >
          Time configuration on the NDR solution must be synchronized with a trusted 
          authoritative time server.
  - id: 2
    title: Traffic Monitoring
    objective: >
      The NDR solution must be properly configured and securely managed for proper 
      cyber threat and anomalous behavior detection in monitored networks.
    risk_implication: >
      Misconfiguration of the NDR solution may have severe consequences like 
      failing to analyze network traffic and recognizing a threat, which could 
      lead to data leakage, attack on partner enterprises or even company clients.
    requirements:
      - id: 2-1
        description: >
          NDR must continually reveal the underlying purpose of traffic, even when 
          the payload is not visible. This allows for protection without prying.
      - id: 2-2
        description: >
          NDR must model a baseline of what normal network behavior looks like and 
          alert security teams on any suspicious traffic that falls outside of that 
          normal range.
      - id: 2-3
        description: >
          NDR must attribute malicious behavior to a specific IP address and perform 
          forensic analyses to determine how threats have moved laterally within 
          an environment.
      - id: 2-4
        description: >
          NDR must provide visibility to multiple public and private cloud environments.
      - id: 2-5
        description: >

          of “always available” or “always denied” resources/attacks which were 
          verified by NDR solution during traffic monitoring.
  - id: 3
    title: Traffic Detection and Logging
    objective: >
      The NDR solution must monitor and process traffic in a secure way to save 
      any suspicious activity and notify the incident response team in case of an 
      unknown new possible incident.
    risk_implication: >
      Traffic detection without proper configuration may easily cause malware 
      propagation, phishing exposure and information leak. Improperly configured 
      NDR solution may result in not sufficiently mitigating new possible security 
      incidents in the future.
    requirements:

          constantly learning behavioral models derived from machine learning.
      - id: 3-2
        description: >
          NDR must utilize advance threats detection and reduce investigation time 
          by capturing metadata and also recognize the unique characteristics of

          NDR must collect and enrich security metadata with deep insights and 
          context that allows it to detect and stop a wide range of attack scenarios 
          early and consistently.
      - id: 3-4
        description: >
          NDR must apply algorithmic models directly to network traffic in order to 
          reveal underlying attack behaviors and then enrich that data with secondary 
          sources (e.g. authentication logs and threat intelligence data) automatically.
      - id: 3-5
        description: >
          NDR must find signs of attackers who tunnel hidden communications within 
          an SSL/TLS-encrypted web session. By analyzing tiny fluctuations in 
          protocols like HTTPS and DNS, NDR solution must reveal when additional 
          layers of communication are hidden within.
      - id: 3-6
        description: >
          NDR must identify a wide range of command-and-control behaviors, including

          intelligence (ML and AI).
      - id: 3-10
        description: >
          NDR must gather data about incidents in a dedicated database. Each record

          like national level CSIRT.
  - id: 4
    title: Automatic Response and Notification
    objective: >
      The NDR solution must use data science and machine learning in order to 
      detect, analyze and protect the systems against future security threats.
    risk_implication: >
      Without proper activity analysis and providing timely alerts for incident 
      response teams, the NDR solution may be ineffective in preventing and 
      mitigating future incidents.
    requirements:
      - id: 4-1
        description: >
          NDR must constantly detect network activity in order to detect ongoing 
          attacks, while security analysts have more time to proactively hunt for 
          threats and investigate incidents with greater success.
      - id: 4-2
        description: >
          NDR must accelerate response time by integrating and sharing security 
          insights with EDR, SIEMs and SOAR tools for endpoint to cloud threat 
          management and visibility.
      - id: 4-3
        description: >
          NDR must deny unauthorized access to prevent access to essential information 
          which might progress attack and compromise sensitive data.
      - id: 4-4

          previously captured anomalies and prevented attacks for future relevance.
      - id: 4-6
        description: >
          Organization should have runbook scenarios for NDR to protect from adversary 
          threats, for instance removing and mitigation a threat by isolating affected 
          systems, detecting and blocking the spreading of malicious links or phishing 
          emails (detection based on local threat intelligence database with ongoing 
          incidents).
      - id: 4-7
        description: >
          NDR must gather all log types from <organization name>’s resources.
      - id: 4-8
        description: >
          NDR must be consistent with the requirements of <organization name>’s Event 
          Log Management and Monitoring Standard.
      - id: 4-9
        description: >
          NDR must be configured to send only specific logs to the central log system 
          e.g. using syslog protocol and CEF, LEEF or RFC 5425 specified log format.
      - id: 4-10
        description: >
          NDR must include at least the following information:
          - date and time of session
          - source IP address
          - user login
          - destination IP
          - action performed
          - used traffic policy
table_a:
  description: >
    There are two major methodologies of NDR deployment:
    - in-line sensors: offer direct response capabilities.
    - passive sensors: rely on integrations.
  methodologies:
    - name: In-line sensors
      description: >
        The method is based on placing the NDR solution directly in the path of a 
        network segment, which allows for fast traffic inspection and dropping 
        anomalous or malicious traffic in real-time.
    - name: Passive sensors
      description: >
        This option revolves around placing an NDR solution inside the network 
        (usually by integrating with SIEM, SOAR, public/private clouds, etc.) and 
        extracting metadata from taken snapshots, which is then sent for analysis.
