    - The reader is the most important person

    - Organise for the convenience of the report user
    - All references should be correct in all details
    - The writing should be accurate, concise, and unobtrusive
    - The right diagram with the right labels should be in the right place for the reader
    - Summaries give the whole picture, in miniature
    - Reports should be checked for technical errors, typing errors, and inconsistency
    - The report should look as good as it is
    - The reader is the most important person (repeated for emphasis)
  objectives:

The objectives of a report are found in matching the reader's need, the information involved, and the appropriate tone, within the clearly defined limits of the report specification."
